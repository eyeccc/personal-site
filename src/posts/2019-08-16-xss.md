[One of my colleagues](http://steven5538.tw) is passionate about web security.
Recently, we asked him if he could share his security knowledge with us.
And therefore we have bi-weekly security sharing session now :D

The first topic in this series is **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**. According to [Hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/resources/top-10-vulnerabilities), it is in the top 10 list of most impactful vulnerability types.

A simple way to explain XSS is that your web application allows untrusted (and usually malicious) script execution. XSS is usually classified as two types: **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS**.

####Stored XSS

Store XSS is a more severe type of XSS. It happens when server trusts users' input and store it on server, which leads to permanent malicious display on normal pages for all other users.

####Reflected XSS
