[One of my colleagues](http://steven5538.tw) is passionate about web security.
Recently, we asked him if he could share his security knowledge with us.
And therefore we have bi-weekly security sharing session now :D I'm going to document what I've learned from him by a series of blog posts.

The first topic in this series is **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**. According to [Hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/resources/top-10-vulnerabilities), it is in the top 10 list of most impactful vulnerability types.

A simple way to explain XSS is that your web application allows untrusted (and usually malicious) script execution. XSS is usually classified as two types: **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS**.

####Stored XSS

Store XSS is a more severe type of XSS. It happens when server trusts (malicious) users' input and store it on server. Without proper HTML escaping, it will lead to permanent display on normal pages for all other users.

Below is an example, how does it cause XSS vulnerability?

```javascript
  onIgnoreTag: function (tag, html, options) {
    // allow comment tag
    if (tag === '!--') {
      // do not filter its attributes
      return html;
    }
  }
```

Think about it for a couple minutes before I explain it ðŸ˜„


####Reflected XSS


#### Try it out!

There is small XSS game for you to try on [here](https://xss-game.appspot.com) if you want to get your hands on using simple technique to execute XSS attack :p
