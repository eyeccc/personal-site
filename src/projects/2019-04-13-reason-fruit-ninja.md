I attended [ReasonConf 2019](https://www.reason-conf.com) this April. The last day of the conference schedule was divided by 2 parts: lightning talk in the morning and Dojo in the afternoon.

This year, there were two topics for the Dojo: using [Atdgen](https://github.com/lessp/atdgen-workshop-starter) or [Reprocessing](https://github.com/bsansouci/reprocessing-example) to build something interesting. You could attend one of them.

The format of Dojo is to find random people who are interested in the same topic to form a small group (approx. 3 ~ 4 people), and let the person with the least ReasonML experience in the group to do the task, with help from others with deeper knowledge.

I chose [Reprocessing](https://github.com/bsansouci/reprocessing-example) since it looked more attractive :p Our goal is to build a fruit ninja game! I collaborated with [@wgoedel](https://twitter.com/wgoedel) and [@rudy_weber](https://twitter.com/rudy_weber) for the initial version ðŸ™Œ I basically did not have any experience of bs-native or [processing](https://processing.org/). Thanks for their help for letting me figure out how to do the physics calculation (the hardest part!) and how to complete this game with minimal functionalities :D

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/eyeccc/reprocessing-fruit-ninja) page, clone and run it to give it a try.
